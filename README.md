# Model Registry Project Structure

This is a Go-based model registry with the following structure:

## Directory Structure

```

```

## Modules

### 1. Storage Module (`internal/storage/`)
- Handles artifact upload/download to S3 or similar storage
- Provides storage interface for different backends
- Manages file metadata and checksums

### 2. Database Module (`internal/database/`)
- Database connection and migration management
- Model metadata storage and retrieval
- Service layer for database operations

### 3. Routes Module (`internal/routes/`)
- HTTP API endpoints
- Request/response handling
- Web application routing

### 4. CLI Module (`cmd/cli/`)
- Command-line interface for API interaction
- Client commands for model management
- Artifact upload/download capabilities

### 5. Server Module (`cmd/server/`)
- Web server application
- API service deployment
- Configuration management

### 6. Client Library (`pkg/client/`)
- Go client library for API interaction
- Can be imported by other Go applications
- Provides programmatic access to the registry

## Getting Started

1. Initialize Go module
2. Add necessary dependencies
3. Implement the modules as needed
4. Configure storage and database
5. Build and deploy
Building a model registry from scratch using golang as a distributed web application
